# Active-Directory-and-Security-Lab

## Objective
As I transition into IT, gaining hands-on experience with Active Directory can be challenging without direct access to enterprise environments. This lab is designed to bridge that gap by allowing me to install and configure Windows Server 2022 with Active Directory, set up a Windows 10 end-user machine, and create a domain to manage users and groups. Additionally, I will incorporate a Kali Linux VM for simulated attacks and a Splunk VM for monitoring, enabling me to analyze security threats in a controlled environment. This lab will serve as a foundational sandbox to refine my skills, troubleshoot real-world scenarios, and deepen my understanding of IT and cybersecurity as I progress in my career.

### Skills Learned

- Installing and configuring Splunk Virtual Machine
- Installing and configuring Windows Server 2022
- Creating OU in Active Directory and managing users
- Enhanced knowledge of cybersecurity threats
- Learn password reset and privealages for different user groups

### Tools Used

- Splunk SIEM to monitor endpoint and Windows Server 2022
- Sysmon for generating endpoint logs and getting experience reading them

-Ubuntu 24.04 Live Server LTS
